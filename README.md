# Remindr

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/lededje/remindr.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A mobile app for forgetful people.

## Running the app

This application uses yarn as an npm wrapper, but npm should also work just fine.

Before trying to run on any platforms `yarn install` or `npm install` to acquire dependencies.

### Running on iOS

MacOS and Xcode are required.

  * Open `ios/remindr.xcode` in Xcode.
  * Hit the Run button

[Running on a device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) is a little more tricky.

### Running on Android

You'll need to have all the [prerequisites](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/ReactAndroid#prerequisites) (SDK, NDK) for Building React Native installed. Android Studio is also recommended.

Open the Android directory and wait for the gradle tasks to run. Then hit the run button.

## Contributing

Although this is mainly a one man band, if you want to contribute just sub a pr. There is an eslint that is checked by code climate and tests must pass on Travis, but apart from that if you got a feature I want to hear about it.

## Feature Requests

If you have a feature request but no time or knowhow to code, submit an issue and I'll look into it.
